                        Vegetarianism is the practice of abstaining from the consumption of meat (red meat, poultry, seafood, and the flesh of any other animal), and may
                        also include abstention from by-products of animal slaughter. Vegetarianism may be adopted for various reasons. Many people object to eating 
                        meat out of respect for sentient life. Such ethical motivations have been codified under various religious beliefs, as well as animal rights advocacy. 
                        Other motivations for vegetarianism are health-related, political, environmental, cultural, aesthetic, economic, or personal preference. There are
                        variations of the diet as well an ovo-lacto vegetarian diet includes both eggs and dairy products, an ovo-vegetarian diet includes eggs but not dairy
                        products, and a lacto-vegetarian diet includes dairy products but not eggs. A vegan diet excludes all animal products, including eggs and dairy.
                        Some vegans also avoid other animal products such as beeswax, leather or silk clothing, and goose-fat shoe polish
